WEBVTT

00:24.367 --> 00:25.243
Pip?

00:25.869 --> 00:27.162
You ready?

00:42.636 --> 00:43.929
How much?

00:45.128 --> 00:46.851
Which one? Which one?

02:07.137 --> 02:08.815
Sawahdee kah!

02:08.976 --> 02:10.203
Kabayan!

02:10.432 --> 02:11.866
- Filipino?
- Yes!

02:12.024 --> 02:13.126
Kabayan!

02:13.158 --> 02:13.952
Kabayan!

02:13.977 --> 02:16.830
Bro, help me out,
you know where this is?

02:16.855 --> 02:18.026
What's the address?

02:18.051 --> 02:19.374
It's my employer, man.

02:19.399 --> 02:20.349
Yeah, I know where that is!

02:20.374 --> 02:21.389
- I'll bring you there.
- Really?

02:21.414 --> 02:22.729
- Come on!
- Seriously?

02:22.754 --> 02:23.982
Yeah, I know it!
Come on.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.728
Thanks, man.

02:25.753 --> 02:28.053
It's good there's a lot of Pinoys
here in Thailand.

02:28.078 --> 02:29.934
Yeah, of course I'll help you.

02:31.301 --> 02:32.842
Appreciate it.

02:39.432 --> 02:42.896
- Kabayan, are we there yet?
- Almost there!

02:47.814 --> 02:50.337
Get all his stuff!
Check his bag!

02:51.446 --> 02:53.665
Hey! Let me go!

02:54.400 --> 02:55.400
Hold him!

03:01.775 --> 03:03.556
There's a Buddhist saying that goes...

03:03.651 --> 03:06.134
"If you meet Buddha on the road,

03:06.364 --> 03:08.110
kill him."

03:08.904 --> 03:12.150
It's probably an illusion.

03:13.077 --> 03:14.180
Me?

03:14.622 --> 03:18.198
I've already seen the most
beautiful illusion.

03:18.223 --> 03:19.223
Hey!

03:20.017 --> 03:21.017
Hey!

03:49.906 --> 03:51.565
Careful.

03:51.650 --> 03:53.392
We're almost there.

03:56.409 --> 03:58.214
Just a sec.

04:04.416 --> 04:05.596
Come in.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.206
Thank you.

04:26.234 --> 04:28.510
Ouch!

04:28.730 --> 04:30.315
Stay there.

04:34.845 --> 04:37.089
I'm going to get medicine for you.

04:49.229 --> 04:50.626
Don't look, alright?

04:50.651 --> 04:52.420
You aren't a pervert,
are you?

04:53.409 --> 04:54.440
No way.

04:59.753 --> 05:02.417
I know you're Filipino,
even if you don't look like one.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.057
Let me do that.

05:09.495 --> 05:10.935
You're like a kid.

07:25.735 --> 07:27.487
Go! I told you to go!

07:27.512 --> 07:28.828
- Don't come here!
- You don't want me anymore?

07:29.005 --> 07:30.628
I don't want you anymore!

07:30.653 --> 07:33.133
- You might regret this.
- Go! Leave me alone!

07:33.251 --> 07:34.412
We broke up!

07:35.070 --> 07:36.124
No!

07:36.149 --> 07:37.984
- I like you.
- I don't like you!

07:39.250 --> 07:40.297
Go!

07:40.322 --> 07:42.077
What the fuck,
go away!

07:42.143 --> 07:43.601
Or I will call the police!

07:43.843 --> 07:46.222
Call them,
so they can deport you!

07:47.437 --> 07:49.068
Is this your new guy?

07:49.320 --> 07:51.366
- Leave us alone!
- You asshole!

07:51.446 --> 07:52.805
Go! Just go!

07:52.830 --> 07:54.965
Stop coming and seeing me!

07:55.437 --> 07:56.466
Go!

07:56.749 --> 07:57.935
Shithead!

07:59.000 --> 08:00.165
Who was that?

08:00.469 --> 08:02.806
My ex. Let's talk inside.

08:18.312 --> 08:19.698
Sorry about that.

08:20.523 --> 08:21.861
So who was it?

08:22.296 --> 08:23.391
My ex.

08:24.355 --> 08:26.774
He owns the bar in Patpong
I used to work at

08:26.799 --> 08:28.500
during my early days in Thailand.

08:28.664 --> 08:29.999
Where do you work now?

08:34.640 --> 08:35.710
Secret.

08:39.860 --> 08:42.413
I came to Thailand
to become a teacher.

08:42.492 --> 08:44.347
But I wasn't so lucky.

08:45.828 --> 08:47.689
That's why I ended up
in Cake's bar.

08:48.218 --> 08:49.239
Cake?

08:49.554 --> 08:51.056
What kind of name
is Cake?

08:51.081 --> 08:52.147
Is that a call sign?

08:52.515 --> 08:55.648
He's a thug,
but his name is Cake.

08:56.438 --> 08:57.827
You moron, it's not like that.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.426
That's just his nickname.

08:59.576 --> 09:01.438
His real name is Ittipong.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.902
- That's just how it is in Thailand.
- Ittipong.

09:05.595 --> 09:08.297
His sibling's name is Donut.

09:10.156 --> 09:12.292
- The fuck?
- Why are you laughing?

09:12.828 --> 09:15.086
If you know what they're like,
you wouldn't be laughing!

09:15.858 --> 09:17.605
- It's a stupid name.
- He has a lot of connections

09:17.630 --> 09:19.174
that's why he can threaten
to have me deported.

09:19.757 --> 09:21.410
What does he really want?

09:24.843 --> 09:27.155
He wants us to get back together,

09:27.180 --> 09:29.055
and go work at his bar again.

09:29.406 --> 09:31.366
But he also wants me
to accept that

09:31.391 --> 09:33.586
he's going to have
other girls, too.

09:34.053 --> 09:35.323
I don't want that!

09:38.267 --> 09:40.214
Not even for your peace of mind?

09:40.239 --> 09:41.328
No thanks!

09:42.850 --> 09:44.310
Wanna go back to
the Philippines, then?

09:44.650 --> 09:46.151
I do, but...

09:46.176 --> 09:48.727
Do I want my siblings to starve?

09:49.843 --> 09:50.942
No way.

09:52.288 --> 09:53.623
Look here,

09:53.861 --> 09:56.343
I bought a cellphone
for my sibling.

09:56.421 --> 09:58.433
Because he wanted
to do Tik-Tok.

09:58.852 --> 10:00.215
It's cute, right?

10:00.594 --> 10:01.633
You?

10:02.210 --> 10:03.491
What will you do now?

10:03.554 --> 10:05.179
Find my employer.

10:05.336 --> 10:07.097
Do you remember the address?

10:08.919 --> 10:10.187
Don't worry.

10:10.328 --> 10:11.762
I'll help you.

10:17.025 --> 10:18.025
Over here.

10:22.257 --> 10:23.734
Here.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.618
I wrote the directions there, okay?

10:25.643 --> 10:26.894
You shouldn't get lost.

10:33.095 --> 10:35.174
I don't get why you're doing this,

10:35.485 --> 10:36.654
but thanks.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.031
Especially for the phone.

10:39.135 --> 10:40.618
You moron, it's nothing!

10:40.978 --> 10:42.815
We'll help each other.
Same country and all.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.319
You keep that for now,
but give it back

10:46.344 --> 10:49.222
because I still need to send that
home to my sibling.

10:49.665 --> 10:50.723
Yes, boss.

10:51.641 --> 10:52.923
Thanks a lot!

11:01.244 --> 11:03.797
You need to walk two blocks,

11:03.822 --> 11:05.352
keep going straight.

11:20.727 --> 11:22.938
When you get to the white building,

11:22.977 --> 11:25.067
take a tuk-tuk.

11:40.341 --> 11:45.302
Then get down and your office
should be there.

11:48.661 --> 11:49.750
No!

11:51.159 --> 11:53.103
We don't have issue this!

11:53.893 --> 11:55.687
We are not looking for employees.

11:55.712 --> 11:56.685
Ma'am,

11:56.710 --> 11:59.466
my agency gave this to me,

11:59.491 --> 12:00.654
this paper.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.230
No, I don't have job.

12:02.332 --> 12:03.291
No agency.

12:03.316 --> 12:04.275
- Okay?
- Ma'am,

12:04.300 --> 12:05.965
- Okay, okay.
- can you give me any job?

12:06.716 --> 12:10.451
Ma'am, please, I'm begging,
I have no one else!

12:43.317 --> 12:44.861
So, how'd it go?

12:48.036 --> 12:49.346
Bad.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.094
It was a scam.

12:51.443 --> 12:52.944
The agency doesn't even exist.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.038
Huh? I don't get it.

12:56.063 --> 12:58.017
They gave me fake documents.

13:00.427 --> 13:01.938
I didn't find work.

13:02.583 --> 13:03.856
Nevermind.

13:06.121 --> 13:08.263
There's loads of work here.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.748
You just need to lay low for now.

13:12.660 --> 13:15.423
I'll ask around the Pinoy Community.

13:23.339 --> 13:24.590
Don't worry.

13:27.317 --> 13:28.552
Let's walk around.

13:31.264 --> 13:32.998
I know how you feel!

13:33.201 --> 13:34.426
I've been there.

13:34.570 --> 13:38.888
When I didn't get a job as a teacher,
I just thought...

13:38.913 --> 13:40.935
What's gonna happen
to my six siblings now?

13:41.060 --> 13:43.802
They already gave me a list
before I even left.

13:43.827 --> 13:46.115
They all wanted shoes.

13:46.311 --> 13:48.130
Like, fuck! What now?

13:50.396 --> 13:52.271
I hooked up with Cake.

13:53.316 --> 13:55.091
I didn't know he had other girls.

13:55.318 --> 13:57.310
And now that I want out,

13:57.335 --> 13:59.280
he's trying to get me back.

14:00.031 --> 14:02.193
I just want to go back to the Philippines.

14:02.218 --> 14:03.325
You sure?

14:06.079 --> 14:08.706
I can help you get
work here, you know.

14:09.541 --> 14:11.334
Probably not in Bangkok, though.

14:12.544 --> 14:14.129
Maybe in the provinces.

14:15.369 --> 14:16.935
At least you'll earn something.

14:18.333 --> 14:19.592
Whatever gets you by, that's it?

14:19.592 --> 14:20.599
Exactly!

14:23.096 --> 14:24.623
I just realized

14:25.306 --> 14:27.475
I've never made a selfish decision.

14:28.007 --> 14:29.607
Everything had to include

14:29.749 --> 14:31.310
my family.

14:31.758 --> 14:34.435
Right? That's why we're
going to have fun now.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.735
But I'm broke!

14:39.127 --> 14:40.833
Did I make you pay
for anything?

14:40.970 --> 14:42.708
It's my treat, so let's go!

14:55.864 --> 15:00.004
I made Cake my boyfriend
so I could keep my job.

17:02.544 --> 17:04.129
You want to just buy clothes?

17:06.708 --> 17:08.204
Or you're sticking to that?

17:08.475 --> 17:09.700
Ow!

17:11.637 --> 17:14.693
Hey, you've got a good eye!

17:16.644 --> 17:17.708
Really?

17:19.366 --> 17:20.497
Yeah!

17:20.901 --> 17:22.629
See? Looks good.

17:40.084 --> 17:41.336
You wanna go here?

17:43.731 --> 17:44.897
No, not here!

17:44.922 --> 17:47.025
- Why?
- I might run into Cake's men.

17:47.050 --> 17:48.843
So what? We're just going
to drink.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.161
Forget it, let's go!

18:11.683 --> 18:14.323
You know, I used to be a bar girl.

18:14.348 --> 18:16.313
That was my first job.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.933
But I'm a college graduate,
mind you!

18:19.045 --> 18:20.088
Really?

18:21.314 --> 18:23.104
You're kind of nosy.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.721
Aren't we buddies?

18:26.464 --> 18:27.924
You took me around town for free.

18:30.126 --> 18:31.502
Shut up and drink.

18:31.761 --> 18:34.013
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

20:44.018 --> 20:45.102
Is that a kiss mark?

20:46.343 --> 20:47.511
Did I do that?

20:49.148 --> 20:50.675
That's a birthmark.

20:50.981 --> 20:52.149
Unique, right?

20:52.892 --> 20:56.851
If I die, I'll be identified immediately.

20:57.107 --> 20:58.650
Why are you so morbid?

20:59.111 --> 21:01.197
We're really talking
about that after sex?

21:02.576 --> 21:04.828
- What topic did you have in mind?
- Anything!

21:05.132 --> 21:07.885
You haven't even told me
where you live!

21:08.459 --> 21:09.602
In Albay.

21:09.627 --> 21:10.728
Albay?

21:10.753 --> 21:12.534
There's a small village there,

21:13.404 --> 21:16.995
where, if you ask anybody,

21:17.218 --> 21:19.845
they know immediately
where Jessy lives.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.390
What about you?
Where do you live?

21:23.419 --> 21:24.573
Isabela.

21:24.965 --> 21:26.733
But I went to highschool in Manila.

21:26.758 --> 21:27.806
With my uncle.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.662
Can I hug you?

21:35.596 --> 21:38.269
Would I refuse now?
Come here.

22:18.329 --> 22:21.524
Here's your fare.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.384
Take care at work, okay?

22:23.409 --> 22:25.250
And don't let go of this.

22:25.562 --> 22:27.736
Most of all, don't let them know you're...

22:27.842 --> 22:29.249
- you know.
- What?

22:29.707 --> 22:30.414
Illegal?

22:30.439 --> 22:32.805
I'm not illegal!
Who are you talking about?

22:35.985 --> 22:37.105
Don't be loud.

22:37.428 --> 22:39.413
But, really, thanks.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.961
If it weren't for you,
I'd never get a job,

22:43.320 --> 22:46.368
I'd probably be back home empty-handed.

22:47.725 --> 22:49.258
Don't mention it.

22:50.611 --> 22:51.718
You know...

22:53.522 --> 22:55.416
I want to visit you

22:55.441 --> 22:56.871
on my days off.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.871
No matter how far,
I'll be there.

23:00.595 --> 23:02.409
You don't need to!

23:02.662 --> 23:04.479
I actually want to do video calls with you.

23:04.854 --> 23:06.893
I charge extra for video calls.

23:06.974 --> 23:08.027
Really?

23:08.420 --> 23:09.472
I'm kidding!

23:09.687 --> 23:11.574
No, really, how much?

23:11.908 --> 23:13.134
I'm kidding, you idiot!

23:13.159 --> 23:14.503
You're too serious!

23:15.461 --> 23:16.813
Line up there!

23:16.924 --> 23:18.425
I need to give you something.

23:19.567 --> 23:21.920
- Oh! You don't need it anymore?
- Nope.

23:22.093 --> 23:23.402
- Got a new one.
- Wow!

23:23.761 --> 23:24.553
Give me that.

23:26.829 --> 23:30.090
Don't really want to see Hello Kitty
while masturbating.

23:37.597 --> 23:38.700
This is it.

23:54.693 --> 23:55.980
Take care.

23:56.687 --> 23:57.688
You, too.

24:09.330 --> 24:10.613
See you around.

24:33.687 --> 24:35.668
Do you know this address?

24:36.144 --> 24:37.398
- Ah, here!
- Here?

24:37.423 --> 24:39.621
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:53.216 --> 25:55.804
- Jessy! How are you?
- I'm good.

25:55.829 --> 25:57.367
I just finished working.

25:57.392 --> 26:00.167
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

26:01.502 --> 26:03.462
I get three square meals a day.

26:03.897 --> 26:05.774
They pay me some

26:05.947 --> 26:07.546
so it's fine.

26:08.141 --> 26:10.741
By the way,
I'll visit you next weekend!

26:12.555 --> 26:15.516
Up to you. I'm always here for you.

26:17.248 --> 26:18.789
Take care.

27:03.332 --> 27:05.251
I'll visit on my day off.

27:05.915 --> 27:06.957
I miss you.

27:07.883 --> 27:11.567
Sure thing. I'm always here.

27:11.826 --> 27:13.474
I'm here.

27:14.158 --> 27:15.784
Show me.

27:17.749 --> 27:18.978
There.

27:19.285 --> 27:20.557
Move closer.

27:22.035 --> 27:23.370
Put your hand in.

27:23.979 --> 27:26.089
Where? Down there?

27:31.943 --> 27:33.347
Lower.

27:33.372 --> 27:34.692
Lower, lower.

27:36.878 --> 27:38.051
Keep going.

28:14.085 --> 28:15.168
Busy?

28:46.254 --> 28:54.402
The subscriber cannot be reached.
Please try again later.

29:01.748 --> 29:02.840
Yes?

29:02.907 --> 29:04.566
You're looking for Jessy?

29:05.483 --> 29:07.443
Yes! Do you know where she is?

29:08.556 --> 29:11.332
Ah, some guys from
immigration took her.

29:11.929 --> 29:13.489
Immigration?

29:25.664 --> 29:27.324
My friend, one more.

30:48.119 --> 30:49.246
Jessy.

30:49.877 --> 30:50.933
What the fuck?

31:20.921 --> 31:22.973
Fuck you, Cake.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.186
Thanks, mister.

32:51.036 --> 32:52.037
Uncle Gani?

32:54.873 --> 32:55.916
Uncle Gani?

32:58.168 --> 32:59.239
What is it?

33:00.254 --> 33:01.231
Uncle,

33:03.082 --> 33:04.113
it's Pip!

33:04.518 --> 33:05.473
Oh!

33:05.707 --> 33:07.612
- Motherfucker!
- How are you?

33:07.782 --> 33:08.871
Wait a sec!

33:12.336 --> 33:13.500
Pip!

33:13.822 --> 33:15.821
What happened to you?

33:19.014 --> 33:20.157
Oh, wait, wait.

33:25.357 --> 33:26.438
Well?

33:27.505 --> 33:29.774
You didn't even say you were coming?

33:29.799 --> 33:30.961
Come in, come in.

33:31.178 --> 33:34.852
Do your parents even know you're back?

33:40.570 --> 33:42.844
I gotta earn money here in Manila first.

33:45.007 --> 33:48.151
What, you think no one will recognize you?

33:48.176 --> 33:49.511
Manila is so small!

33:49.944 --> 33:51.133
Doesn't matter.

33:51.983 --> 33:53.001
Wait a minute.

33:53.137 --> 33:54.884
Why did you think

33:55.462 --> 33:56.711
to come here?

34:02.139 --> 34:03.274
Well.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.003
You're my asshole of an uncle!

34:06.028 --> 34:06.852
Oh!

34:07.118 --> 34:09.537
Sorry, sorry. Uncle.

34:09.562 --> 34:11.188
Fine, you can stay here.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.752
But don't give me a headache.

34:13.777 --> 34:14.969
I won't.

34:15.342 --> 34:19.657
Your folks might think I'm
letting you get away with shit!

34:27.883 --> 34:29.426
Uncle! What's that?

34:29.539 --> 34:32.009
Wait, that's mine.

34:32.207 --> 34:33.704
So what is it?

34:37.679 --> 34:38.844
Betting App.

34:38.986 --> 34:40.037
Betting?

34:41.229 --> 34:41.938
Yeah!

34:42.342 --> 34:44.069
You've never heard of it?

34:44.149 --> 34:45.407
Online gambling.

34:45.657 --> 34:47.369
There's a lot of games here.

34:47.394 --> 34:48.680
You have Cara Y Cruz.

34:48.931 --> 34:50.433
There's color game,

34:50.734 --> 34:52.118
Tong-its.

34:52.874 --> 34:55.039
Oh, it's like... online cockfighting.

34:55.285 --> 34:56.610
They have that, too.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.427
Does it pay a lot, uncle?

35:00.666 --> 35:02.648
Pay? This is gambling!

35:03.149 --> 35:08.440
You'll only know how much you get
once you play.

35:08.924 --> 35:10.977
How do you get the money?

35:11.312 --> 35:13.141
E-cash.

35:13.460 --> 35:14.695
Online banking.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.406
Hey Pip.

35:17.595 --> 35:19.056
Don't even think about it.

35:19.695 --> 35:21.779
You're broke enough as it is.

35:22.260 --> 35:23.672
What's this

35:24.314 --> 35:27.180
"Knock-Out" at Pataya?

35:27.589 --> 35:29.062
I can't get in.

35:29.172 --> 35:31.367
I haven't tried that yet.

35:31.392 --> 35:36.021
I think you need 100 thousand pesos
credits to get in.

35:37.835 --> 35:39.304
Look at those girls there,

35:39.329 --> 35:42.008
the ones manning the rooms.

35:42.033 --> 35:44.946
This is just a rumor I heard...

35:44.971 --> 35:48.988
Those girls go naked
and give live shows!

35:49.013 --> 35:51.680
But you need
to have 100 thousand pesos.

35:51.705 --> 35:53.944
I don't have that kind of money.

35:53.969 --> 35:58.360
And if I did, why would I
waste it on beat-ups and boobs?

37:01.029 --> 37:04.328
High, please! High, high!

37:11.266 --> 37:12.953
Shit!

37:23.970 --> 37:25.953
Finally, I'm winning!

38:00.833 --> 38:02.348
Jessy?

40:43.461 --> 40:45.088
Wait, I'm confused.

40:46.115 --> 40:48.201
So you're saying that you came here,

40:48.226 --> 40:49.686
right here at the precinct,

40:50.083 --> 40:52.502
to look for a missing woman,

40:53.143 --> 40:55.562
who isn't actually missing
because you saw her?

40:55.687 --> 40:57.063
Kind of, yeah.

40:58.184 --> 41:00.270
You're saying she was kidnapped?

41:00.442 --> 41:03.064
She wasn't kidnapped.
I told you, I just saw her.

41:03.336 --> 41:06.681
Hang on, did you try
all her social media accounts?

41:07.615 --> 41:09.117
What about her number? Just text her.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.087
I've done all that.

41:11.786 --> 41:14.400
It's either deactivated,
or just keeps ringing.

41:14.651 --> 41:16.189
Maybe you got ghosted.

41:17.988 --> 41:21.392
You know, boy.
I don't think you need our help.

41:22.630 --> 41:24.215
You'll have better luck
pitching to Jessica Soho.

41:24.240 --> 41:25.617
Send your story to their show.

41:27.260 --> 41:29.611
We're busy with actual crimes here.

41:30.472 --> 41:33.400
Just last night,
a father stabbed their kid.

41:33.795 --> 41:35.617
An addict and a drunkard.

41:35.715 --> 41:38.673
We're not going to
prioritize you over that, sonny.

41:39.373 --> 41:41.041
Got it, sir. Thanks anyway.

41:46.639 --> 41:47.703
Wait.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.717
You said you saw this woman again, right?

41:50.742 --> 41:51.752
Where?

41:52.645 --> 41:54.855
Let's hit up DSWD or something.

41:55.199 --> 41:56.242
I feel bad for you.

41:57.290 --> 41:59.853
Don't pity me.

42:00.317 --> 42:01.478
Come on!

42:02.039 --> 42:03.750
Just tell me where you saw her.

42:04.657 --> 42:05.852
Online.

42:07.634 --> 42:10.681
I thought you said you already
hit up her socials?

42:11.934 --> 42:13.235
Online gambling.

42:16.247 --> 42:21.345
She ferries players.

42:23.212 --> 42:25.356
How can you tell it's her?

42:25.443 --> 42:26.853
I know something about her.

42:29.774 --> 42:32.454
Alright. Let's dig into this.

42:33.263 --> 42:34.853
Online gambling, huh?

42:50.896 --> 42:52.481
From what we know,

42:53.109 --> 42:55.098
that compound is where
their operations are.

42:56.930 --> 42:58.349
You know someone from the inside?

42:59.980 --> 43:01.663
We've had complaints but,

43:01.688 --> 43:03.210
we don't have any evidence.

43:03.748 --> 43:07.418
And their business is registered,
so we can't do anything.

43:10.814 --> 43:14.023
Just don't let them know
you got their address from us.

43:17.068 --> 43:18.227
Good day.

43:20.281 --> 43:21.379
What is it?

43:21.690 --> 43:26.236
Hello. I wanted to apply for
an IT position for the Pataya App.

43:26.261 --> 43:29.806
They said this was
the application center?

43:30.133 --> 43:33.219
Someone referred me here,
maybe you know them.

43:33.741 --> 43:34.999
Here.

43:39.692 --> 43:40.906
Aiko!

43:45.347 --> 43:46.484
What?

43:52.505 --> 43:54.632
Why are you showing us
someone's boobs?

43:54.657 --> 43:58.421
You think we know
each other's boobs here?

43:59.662 --> 44:00.496
No, I mean--

44:00.521 --> 44:01.856
Wait! I know her!

44:02.060 --> 44:03.202
Really?

44:03.656 --> 44:06.616
Wait! Kate! Kate!

44:07.587 --> 44:10.089
Girl with a birthmark
on her boob, this guy's asking.

44:36.199 --> 44:37.784
Me? Are you looking for me?

44:43.292 --> 44:44.459
Sorry.

44:44.707 --> 44:45.875
I didn't mean to...

44:47.160 --> 44:48.078
stare.

44:50.551 --> 44:51.500
My cellphone.

44:55.134 --> 44:56.636
Alright, you guys go upstairs.

45:13.319 --> 45:17.991
Okay, so now that you've
seen me, what do you want?

45:20.493 --> 45:23.663
Sorry. I was just looking for a woman

45:24.330 --> 45:25.723
with a birthmark on her chest.

45:25.864 --> 45:27.550
It looks like a heart, like yours.

45:29.442 --> 45:34.822
When I saw you on the app,
I thought I found her.

45:36.979 --> 45:41.859
And now you know that it's not me,
why are you still here?

45:42.022 --> 45:45.730
Well, I saw you and thought...

45:47.152 --> 45:49.078
maybe we could be friends.

45:49.792 --> 45:52.355
Wow, that's some pick-up line.

45:52.620 --> 45:54.585
How many girls have you used it on?

45:54.610 --> 45:56.285
It's not a pick-up line.

45:56.310 --> 45:57.699
I'm just being honest.

46:02.181 --> 46:03.379
Here.

46:05.163 --> 46:07.293
Oh shit, it's real.

46:08.458 --> 46:10.879
But that's not me.

46:11.859 --> 46:13.246
Is she your girlfriend?

46:18.890 --> 46:20.975
Well, our birthmarks are different.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.801
Hers is shaped like a heart.
Mine is...

46:23.121 --> 46:26.855
shaped like a dong.

46:28.394 --> 46:29.812
Hey, I'm proud of it!

46:30.496 --> 46:33.278
It doesn't grow when you caress it, though.

46:35.034 --> 46:36.219
I'm Kate.

46:37.261 --> 46:38.469
Pip.

46:44.410 --> 46:45.910
Ah, Kate!

46:45.935 --> 46:48.012
Could I have your number?

46:48.372 --> 46:50.600
I'm not easy to get, but...

46:50.625 --> 46:51.851
if...

46:51.876 --> 46:55.379
you're really interested,
you can visit later.

46:56.211 --> 46:59.379
You already know where we live.

47:33.105 --> 47:34.436
Shit.

47:41.634 --> 47:42.677
Pip, you fucking moron!

47:43.356 --> 47:45.138
Lock your damn door!

47:45.163 --> 47:46.692
Pervert!

47:48.457 --> 47:50.910
Goddamn it!

48:05.825 --> 48:07.618
- Uncle!
- Let's eat.

48:08.523 --> 48:10.043
Sorry about last night.

48:12.832 --> 48:15.496
Can we not talk about that shit?

48:15.521 --> 48:17.153
I might lose my appetite.

48:17.178 --> 48:18.443
Sorry, uncle.

48:25.386 --> 48:27.180
How's the job hunt going?

48:28.389 --> 48:30.391
It's going.

48:35.980 --> 48:39.715
Oh, your mom called.

48:42.445 --> 48:43.446
She's asking for money.

48:44.720 --> 48:47.613
Said she'll pay me back
when you've sent them some.

48:48.301 --> 48:49.843
Alright, I'll take care of it.

48:52.663 --> 48:55.374
Go find some work first you dumbass,

48:55.625 --> 48:56.918
so you can actually send something.

48:57.335 --> 49:00.004
Stop jacking off!

49:35.551 --> 49:36.749
Hi!

49:38.334 --> 49:39.752
What are you here for?

49:40.628 --> 49:42.046
I'm waiting for Kate.

49:42.380 --> 49:43.798
Are you her boyfriend?

49:44.230 --> 49:45.442
No, just a friend.

49:46.770 --> 49:47.903
Fubu?

49:49.095 --> 49:50.653
What's Fubu?

49:51.973 --> 49:53.106
Nevermind.

49:54.715 --> 49:56.258
Do you know who I am?

49:57.019 --> 49:59.772
Has Kate told you about me?

50:00.164 --> 50:00.957
No.

50:00.982 --> 50:03.207
Are you one of the other girls?

50:05.528 --> 50:06.487
Me?

50:08.155 --> 50:12.118
I know we're close in age,

50:13.953 --> 50:14.870
but,

50:15.721 --> 50:17.515
I assure you,

50:17.540 --> 50:19.000
we work in different departments.

50:21.460 --> 50:23.462
Sorry, ma'am, but who are you?

50:24.171 --> 50:25.223
Nina.

50:25.673 --> 50:29.707
I'm one of the operators here.

50:30.037 --> 50:34.361
I take care of the girls.

50:35.625 --> 50:38.879
So tell me. What do you want from Kate?

50:39.442 --> 50:41.236
I just want to be friends.

50:42.309 --> 50:43.978
Don't take me for a fool, boy.

50:44.236 --> 50:47.030
I know that leads to fucking in the end!

50:47.172 --> 50:49.439
I don't have a problem with that.

50:51.365 --> 50:52.116
But,

50:53.159 --> 50:54.452
what work do you do?

50:55.181 --> 50:58.793
Don't tell me my girl
has to feed you, too?

50:59.699 --> 51:02.418
Honestly, I'm still looking for work.

51:02.667 --> 51:06.448
I'm supposed to be in Thailand. OFW.
But I got scammed.

51:10.468 --> 51:12.136
What can you do?

51:13.362 --> 51:14.645
Plenty.

51:24.573 --> 51:27.418
Call me if you can't find anything.

51:29.278 --> 51:30.946
Maybe I'll have something for you.

51:32.823 --> 51:33.616
Thanks.

51:34.450 --> 51:36.243
Take care, you two.

51:36.268 --> 51:38.979
I guess you've met my boss!

51:41.624 --> 51:43.761
Don't get knocked up, okay?

51:43.786 --> 51:45.395
I'll go now.

52:22.120 --> 52:23.838
Whoever you're thinking of,

52:24.972 --> 52:26.473
I'm the one here now.

55:52.202 --> 55:53.288
Pip.

55:54.126 --> 55:55.344
Wake up.

55:56.046 --> 55:57.391
We still have work.

55:57.836 --> 56:02.938
Huh? Work? What time?

56:07.437 --> 56:08.771
It's nine o'clock.

56:10.034 --> 56:12.789
I guess you had fun last night!

56:17.905 --> 56:19.054
Kate.

56:20.159 --> 56:21.244
What is it?

56:21.578 --> 56:22.640
Sorry.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.282
For what?

56:26.149 --> 56:27.316
For last night.

56:29.924 --> 56:31.967
I was hammered last night.

56:33.369 --> 56:35.455
I don't really have sex with others.

56:35.973 --> 56:38.600
Okay... why are you explaining this?

56:38.641 --> 56:40.476
I want it to be... just us.

56:41.297 --> 56:43.164
I don't want you to
think differently of me.

56:43.407 --> 56:44.594
That's alright.

56:45.032 --> 56:48.334
I mean, just because
you have sex with others

56:48.359 --> 56:50.055
doesn't mean you love them, right?

56:51.787 --> 56:53.413
But I'm only after you.

56:55.495 --> 56:57.831
You know what, I'll tell you.

56:58.266 --> 57:01.418
If we do end up being a thing,
I'm cool if you have sex with others.

57:02.293 --> 57:06.698
I know the girls here
will take care of you.

57:07.513 --> 57:11.225
And I know the girls who
will have sex with you anyway.

57:11.250 --> 57:13.618
- Right, ladies?
- Of course.

57:14.317 --> 57:15.568
Are you serious?

57:17.556 --> 57:18.807
Do I look like I'm kidding?

57:23.211 --> 57:24.462
I don't know.

57:26.039 --> 57:27.749
I've never met anyone like you.

57:30.238 --> 57:31.614
Get used to it.

57:34.075 --> 57:37.343
Go on, I have work to do.

59:44.711 --> 59:45.906
There's your kid.

01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:04.741
You piece of shit!

01:00:05.437 --> 01:00:06.811
Sixta, that's enough!

01:00:08.616 --> 01:00:09.647
Pip!

01:00:10.276 --> 01:00:11.902
You think you can lie to me?

01:00:12.717 --> 01:00:15.045
I thought you were in Thailand!

01:00:15.413 --> 01:00:18.349
Where did you come from?
Did you actually go to Thailand?

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:22.035
The agency was fake.

01:00:22.387 --> 01:00:23.972
There was nothing for me there.

01:00:25.303 --> 01:00:26.660
When did you come home?

01:00:28.263 --> 01:00:29.918
Are you trying to make fools out of us?

01:00:29.943 --> 01:00:31.085
No.

01:00:33.113 --> 01:00:34.692
I'm really not, mom.

01:00:34.989 --> 01:00:37.884
Then you should have just come home!

01:00:38.122 --> 01:00:40.100
Why didn't you tell me anything?

01:00:40.226 --> 01:00:43.032
I don't know what
you're doing with your life

01:00:43.087 --> 01:00:44.755
and with ours!

01:00:45.427 --> 01:00:48.480
I thought you said
you were going to help?

01:00:48.505 --> 01:00:50.513
But here you are wasting your life away,

01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:53.233
like you don't have a family!

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:57.161
Your father is old!

01:00:58.371 --> 01:00:59.481
Mom.

01:01:01.434 --> 01:01:02.575
Don't worry.

01:01:03.457 --> 01:01:05.012
I found work.

01:01:08.809 --> 01:01:09.874
What is it?

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:14.089
Look at you. All that bravado.

01:01:14.114 --> 01:01:16.653
Now you're begging.

01:01:17.411 --> 01:01:19.287
What do you have for me?

01:01:20.229 --> 01:01:22.292
Do you think you get to choose?

01:01:22.317 --> 01:01:24.656
I thought you said
you had plenty of talents,

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.100
and you're up for anything?

01:01:28.087 --> 01:01:30.295
I don't know if I can do sex work.

01:01:30.971 --> 01:01:33.763
Why would you think that?

01:01:34.249 --> 01:01:35.708
It's getting late.

01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:41.281
Well. Everyone who works
sells their body in a way.

01:01:41.987 --> 01:01:45.657
Chefs get wounded.

01:01:46.145 --> 01:01:51.192
Call center agents develop
hypertension from stress.

01:01:52.774 --> 01:01:57.487
You can't get anywhere
without selling your body.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:03.003
So what is it then?
Am I gonna be a call boy?

01:02:04.451 --> 01:02:05.633
No.

01:02:06.368 --> 01:02:07.452
Then what?

01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:12.541
No more questions.

01:02:16.701 --> 01:02:18.119
Where are we going?

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:24.599
Are you deaf?
Didn't I say no more questions?

01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:28.627
You'll have to excuse me,
I've had bad experiences on narrow alleys.

01:02:34.882 --> 01:02:38.599
Welcome to your new office.

01:02:42.406 --> 01:02:43.692
What is this?

01:02:44.085 --> 01:02:46.489
This is Patayan (To the Death).

01:02:49.692 --> 01:02:52.299
I don't like this shit.

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:58.400
I thought you could do lots of things?

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.311
But I'm not a boxer.

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:03.223
You just need to fight.

01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:08.946
Haven't you gotten into fistfghts
when you were younger?

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:14.041
Sorry, Nina, I can't do this.

01:03:14.587 --> 01:03:20.213
Even if I tell you 80 thousand is the
lowest you can get when you lose?

01:03:20.439 --> 01:03:24.637
Obviously, it's bigger if you win.

01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:30.227
There's no age limit,

01:03:30.252 --> 01:03:34.488
no weight divisions. Just fight.

01:03:34.991 --> 01:03:37.279
But how do you earn from this?

01:03:38.813 --> 01:03:40.400
You see this?

01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:49.013
This match right now
has a total bet of eight million.

01:03:50.037 --> 01:03:52.665
And that isn't a big fight.

01:03:53.034 --> 01:03:57.959
It's just like online cockfighting,
but with people.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.528
But unlike cockfighting,

01:04:04.553 --> 01:04:07.398
here, entertainment is important.

01:04:07.423 --> 01:04:13.397
The audience wants blood and broken bones.

01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:18.075
No gloves, no safety.

01:04:21.417 --> 01:04:27.214
Our audience are businessmen. Politicians.

01:04:27.434 --> 01:04:30.099
They're sick and tired of their safe lives.

01:04:30.124 --> 01:04:35.171
Every now and then,
to release their animal instinct,

01:04:35.196 --> 01:04:38.251
they want to participate
in something risky.

01:04:38.276 --> 01:04:40.152
Violence.

01:04:40.334 --> 01:04:44.839
Stuff they can't experience
from their penthouse condominiums.

01:04:44.864 --> 01:04:48.918
We had one boxer
who got so beat up,

01:04:48.943 --> 01:04:53.199
he ended up with a
hole in his lungs. Dead.

01:04:53.224 --> 01:04:58.764
But because the fight was good,
one of our high betters took pity on him.

01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:03.054
They added an extra 50 thousand
as an offering to the family.

01:05:03.079 --> 01:05:04.638
Not a bad deal.

01:05:04.663 --> 01:05:08.238
"Not a bad deal"? These are
people's lives on the line.

01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:13.112
If he were alive, where would
he get 50 thousand?

01:05:14.575 --> 01:05:18.912
I'm pretty sure he'd rather die for it.

01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:45.149
Thank you.

01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:01.961
Take care, you two.

01:06:04.883 --> 01:06:07.786
Hey, why didn't you say
you were with Miss Nina?

01:06:10.025 --> 01:06:11.036
Come on.

01:06:11.628 --> 01:06:14.351
Where did you go,
why didn't you tell me?

01:06:17.415 --> 01:06:19.459
I just asked her for work.

01:06:22.476 --> 01:06:23.620
Okay. It's cool.

01:06:24.739 --> 01:06:26.198
You just forgot to mention.

01:06:28.773 --> 01:06:30.650
Hey, I'm not jealous, okay!

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:34.782
What?

01:06:36.588 --> 01:06:37.255
Nothing.

01:06:38.526 --> 01:06:39.485
You're so cute.

01:06:40.279 --> 01:06:43.491
Yuck! What's wrong with you? Move.

01:06:46.043 --> 01:06:47.753
Hey, by the way...

01:06:48.139 --> 01:06:50.607
what kind of work
did Miss Nina offer?

01:06:51.482 --> 01:06:52.524
Knock-Out.

01:06:53.888 --> 01:06:54.639
What do you think?

01:06:55.875 --> 01:06:56.834
Should I take it?

01:07:00.337 --> 01:07:01.297
Up to you.

01:07:02.482 --> 01:07:03.858
If you think you can take it.

01:07:06.811 --> 01:07:08.313
Do you have other options?

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:14.697
There's your answer.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:31.881
This used to be a warehouse.
Closed because of the pandemic.

01:07:32.764 --> 01:07:35.019
You can use anything you like here.

01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:39.649
Shower and lockers at the back.

01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:46.156
That's Anjo. He's one
of the best boxers here.

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:49.699
Last night he won 250 thousand.

01:07:50.465 --> 01:07:52.967
Talk to him, maybe he'll give you tips.

01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:35.836
Don't be fussy.

01:09:46.398 --> 01:09:48.858
Here, water.

01:09:56.937 --> 01:09:59.339
Let's eat!

01:12:21.495 --> 01:12:22.495
Kate!

01:12:23.076 --> 01:12:24.076
Kate!

01:12:25.077 --> 01:12:26.077
Kate!

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:28.761
Kate!

01:12:29.113 --> 01:12:30.220
Kate!

01:12:31.269 --> 01:12:33.104
- Kate, let me explain!
- Let go of me!

01:12:33.129 --> 01:12:34.333
What's your problem?

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:37.337
What?

01:12:37.362 --> 01:12:39.980
I thought you said it's cool.

01:12:40.005 --> 01:12:41.436
You said that.

01:12:41.461 --> 01:12:44.548
It's fine if it's with someone
you know, hell, that's even better.

01:12:44.795 --> 01:12:46.463
I thought it was okay.

01:12:47.799 --> 01:12:49.217
I really did.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.887
But when I saw you
with Nina, it felt different.

01:12:58.433 --> 01:13:00.853
This setup used to be fine
with my exes, I was okay with it.

01:13:00.878 --> 01:13:02.713
I didn't have a problem, but,

01:13:04.655 --> 01:13:05.948
I don't know.

01:13:07.313 --> 01:13:08.356
I don't know anymore.

01:13:11.589 --> 01:13:12.600
What is it?

01:13:12.731 --> 01:13:13.764
Just wait.

01:13:17.466 --> 01:13:19.093
I have something to confess.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:23.252
I just want to know if
Jessy is the girl from the app.

01:13:24.234 --> 01:13:29.418
And I'm telling you,
you can be part of our operation!

01:13:29.443 --> 01:13:30.694
As an informant.

01:13:31.208 --> 01:13:34.503
Get in, know how things work.

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:36.969
Use that lady friend you met.

01:13:38.333 --> 01:13:40.639
As soon as when we have enough evidence--

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:44.628
if there's prostitution, or
anything illegal associated with

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:47.297
that online gambling,
then we'll take them to court.

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.184
Of course, you'll get a reward.

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.347
It's not much, but it'll help.

01:13:52.886 --> 01:13:55.472
It'll help your life with
that woman you're looking for.

01:13:57.018 --> 01:13:58.436
I said yes.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.002
Fuck you!

01:14:01.824 --> 01:14:03.284
Listen to me.

01:14:04.695 --> 01:14:05.863
I'm falling for you.

01:14:06.854 --> 01:14:07.855
Sorry I didn't tell you.

01:14:10.889 --> 01:14:13.517
Is that from a script the
police told you to say?

01:14:23.955 --> 01:14:25.149
I love you.

01:14:40.238 --> 01:14:41.614
Here's your coffee.

01:14:51.292 --> 01:14:52.210
Good morning.

01:14:52.586 --> 01:14:53.420
Yes?

01:14:54.096 --> 01:14:55.389
Is Kate there?

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:57.497
Come in.

01:14:57.533 --> 01:14:58.284
Thanks.

01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:59.621
Not here.

01:15:00.403 --> 01:15:01.946
She's not here.

01:15:01.971 --> 01:15:04.598
We don't know where she is.
She didn't come home.

01:15:04.858 --> 01:15:05.776
Did she run away?

01:15:06.453 --> 01:15:11.124
She left her things but
she didn't say she was leaving.

01:15:11.919 --> 01:15:13.587
What happened?

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:21.975
Sorry for the trouble. Sorry.

01:15:27.749 --> 01:15:30.576
Chief. Can we talk?

01:15:30.981 --> 01:15:32.027
About what?

01:15:32.649 --> 01:15:33.691
The... you know...

01:15:36.262 --> 01:15:37.555
Okay, let's talk there.

01:15:53.128 --> 01:15:53.963
What's up?

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:56.677
Chief.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:59.439
I can't do what you want.

01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:01.497
I'm going crazy.

01:16:01.741 --> 01:16:06.204
Even Kate left me!
No one knows where she is!

01:16:06.817 --> 01:16:07.735
She's missing?

01:16:09.013 --> 01:16:10.556
What makes you say she left you?

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:14.143
She's part of a gambling circle.

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:16.840
Anything could have happened to her.

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:20.046
Like?

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.598
I really don't want to say but...

01:16:25.334 --> 01:16:26.252
she could have been kidnapped?

01:16:27.204 --> 01:16:29.298
Killed? Beaten up?

01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:32.343
What's the last thing you did with her?

01:16:35.497 --> 01:16:36.911
We fought.

01:16:40.252 --> 01:16:42.212
I told her about the operation.

01:16:42.568 --> 01:16:43.820
You fucking moron!

01:16:44.943 --> 01:16:47.224
Don't you know what confidential means?

01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:48.937
I trust Kate!

01:16:49.075 --> 01:16:50.243
And now she's missing!

01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:55.357
What if she ran to her bosses?

01:16:56.803 --> 01:16:58.886
What if you're next?

01:16:59.438 --> 01:17:00.689
And you go missing, too?

01:17:02.559 --> 01:17:04.603
Go on, leave, we're not gonna stop you.

01:17:05.105 --> 01:17:08.149
But I can't guarantee that
you'll be safe if something happens.

01:17:18.359 --> 01:17:19.778
What do I need to do?

01:17:22.391 --> 01:17:23.851
Just follow our instructions.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.809
And I'll make sure you're safe.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.238
Deal?

01:19:25.695 --> 01:19:26.863
Can we talk?

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:34.019
Why haven't you answered my texts?

01:19:35.084 --> 01:19:36.210
I'll fight again.

01:19:37.429 --> 01:19:39.139
I gave your slot away.

01:19:39.353 --> 01:19:41.105
To who?

01:19:43.495 --> 01:19:45.026
Chikoy.

01:19:45.783 --> 01:19:48.221
He's gonna fight Anjo.

01:19:48.391 --> 01:19:49.550
Anjo?

01:19:49.633 --> 01:19:51.218
What can he do against Anjo?

01:19:52.131 --> 01:19:54.425
Anjo will slaughter him!
Take him out!

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.642
Why don't you remove him instead?

01:19:58.393 --> 01:19:59.757
Then.

01:20:00.062 --> 01:20:01.380
Take him out.

01:20:31.908 --> 01:20:35.275
Any news? Did you get a fight?

01:20:35.484 --> 01:20:38.851
They didn't give it to me,
but I have a plan.

01:20:39.650 --> 01:20:42.490
Chief. The fight is staged.

01:20:44.981 --> 01:20:46.191
I'll place my life on your hands.

01:20:47.722 --> 01:20:50.516
Yeah, just calm down.
We'll take care of you.

01:20:51.573 --> 01:20:52.741
Don't worry.

01:20:53.343 --> 01:20:54.895
Get into the fight.

01:20:55.421 --> 01:20:58.215
Before the three rounds are over,
we'll raid the place.

01:22:06.168 --> 01:22:10.763
We've gotten a number
of complaints about you.

01:22:12.034 --> 01:22:14.105
But you're a legit business, right?

01:22:14.718 --> 01:22:17.513
You have your papers,
so we won't take a swing at you.

01:22:19.112 --> 01:22:21.167
So what do you need from us?

01:22:21.355 --> 01:22:23.626
Does Boss Paps know about this?

01:22:23.713 --> 01:22:25.757
We just want to partner up with you.

01:22:26.168 --> 01:22:27.313
Partner?

01:22:28.007 --> 01:22:29.155
How?

01:22:29.322 --> 01:22:30.837
We're not POGO.

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:34.421
You wanna keep raking in cash,
don't you? So do we.

01:22:35.662 --> 01:22:39.082
We've thought of a market
you haven't tapped into yet.

01:22:39.964 --> 01:22:43.051
Live shows and underground boxing.

01:22:43.349 --> 01:22:45.669
But this isn't for your small fish.

01:22:46.374 --> 01:22:49.584
We'll just use the app
and then we'll split the spoils.

01:22:49.956 --> 01:22:52.083
Where would we get these boxers?

01:22:52.389 --> 01:22:55.447
Who wants to bet on something
that's underground?

01:22:55.472 --> 01:22:57.411
We don't need to find a fighter!

01:22:58.353 --> 01:23:03.043
Just people who can fight
and are desperate for money.

01:23:03.105 --> 01:23:04.857
Isn't that more exciting?

01:23:05.476 --> 01:23:07.781
Just like the battle of YouTubers!

01:23:08.134 --> 01:23:09.783
You can use your girls, too.

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.840
What do you mean?

01:23:14.133 --> 01:23:17.276
They can lure in men
to join the betting app.

01:23:19.329 --> 01:23:20.704
Hold on,

01:23:21.235 --> 01:23:22.903
I'm a little confused.

01:23:23.997 --> 01:23:25.969
Why do you need to do this?

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:29.228
We're legal! Legal!

01:23:29.454 --> 01:23:33.384
Let's just say that we need
to make a little revenue.

01:23:33.774 --> 01:23:37.211
It's for the politicians
running next election.

01:23:37.564 --> 01:23:40.856
It's 2025. How time flies, right?

01:23:41.943 --> 01:23:45.113
No. I don't agree to this, alright?

01:23:45.511 --> 01:23:46.762
I don't want this kind of trouble.

01:23:47.227 --> 01:23:48.437
That's the wrong answer.

01:23:48.887 --> 01:23:51.306
We'll put you through
something much worse

01:23:51.331 --> 01:23:53.041
if you don't agree to this.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.682
Come on!

01:23:56.992 --> 01:23:59.584
Want the money, or not?

01:24:03.057 --> 01:24:06.830
Thanks for your cooperation.
You won't regret it.

01:24:07.536 --> 01:24:11.012
Thanks for your help finding Jessy.

01:24:26.134 --> 01:24:29.372
Hello, Nina? Good afternoon, how are you?

01:24:31.056 --> 01:24:32.683
Yes, I have a prospect for you.

01:24:38.445 --> 01:24:39.568
Hello, sis?

01:24:40.292 --> 01:24:41.284
Yeah?

01:24:42.387 --> 01:24:44.204
Yeah, I'll take care of it,
I'll send money.

01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:45.909
100 thousand minimum.

01:24:47.519 --> 01:24:49.563
I'll take care of it, sis,
you'll have it soon.

01:24:50.306 --> 01:24:51.205
Okay?

01:25:01.094 --> 01:25:04.080
Fuck, man, sorry about this,
I need this fight.

01:25:38.007 --> 01:25:39.866
Give me the fight.

01:25:42.309 --> 01:25:43.860
Please.

01:25:44.193 --> 01:25:45.402
Give the fight to me.

01:25:46.612 --> 01:25:48.715
You really took it seriously.

01:25:48.771 --> 01:25:49.987
All right.

01:25:50.484 --> 01:25:51.610
It's yours.

01:25:52.643 --> 01:25:54.979
But this fight is special.

01:25:55.667 --> 01:25:56.960
What?

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.389
What do you mean?

01:25:59.029 --> 01:26:00.469
Win or lose...

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:06.677
100 thousand
is the lowest you'll get.

01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:08.137
But...

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:13.524
you can get as much
as 500 thousand.

01:26:15.226 --> 01:26:17.508
Are you going to fight again?

01:26:19.433 --> 01:26:21.187
What's the special arrangement?

01:26:23.572 --> 01:26:26.215
You need to lose on purpose.

01:26:28.871 --> 01:26:30.039
What?

01:26:30.663 --> 01:26:32.081
Why would I do that?

01:26:36.034 --> 01:26:36.993
Okay.

01:26:38.103 --> 01:26:41.144
I'll tell you since I trust you,

01:26:41.733 --> 01:26:47.459
we have a bettor who's
a businessman. Very wealthy!

01:26:48.953 --> 01:26:49.954
But...

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:54.626
he plans to run in the next election.

01:26:55.807 --> 01:27:02.367
He needs funds, and he needs
to win, so he can protect us.

01:27:05.151 --> 01:27:08.900
So the fight is staged.
Do you consent?

01:27:13.599 --> 01:27:15.309
Am I up against Anjo?

01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:18.360
Yes.

01:27:19.645 --> 01:27:21.480
Is there a problem?

01:29:53.304 --> 01:29:56.224
Goddamn you, Pip, what
did you do to my brother?

01:29:56.499 --> 01:30:01.001
Chikoy just wanted to help
send our siblings to school!

01:30:02.344 --> 01:30:04.589
and you almost beat him to death?

01:30:06.231 --> 01:30:09.401
He'd be in bigger trouble
if he continued the fight.

01:30:12.758 --> 01:30:13.843
Where did you go?

01:30:14.384 --> 01:30:15.869
- What happened to you?
- Listen very carefully!

01:30:15.894 --> 01:30:17.574
I don't have much time.

01:30:17.599 --> 01:30:18.879
Kate, what do you mean?

01:30:19.097 --> 01:30:20.348
- Why are you running out of time?
- Just listen to me, please!

01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:23.977
- The fuck happened to you?
- Just listen to me, please!

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:26.698
That policeman S.E. Publito guy--

01:30:27.733 --> 01:30:30.942
He's a pawn and in cahoots
with that fucking Nina!

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:34.137
They're using you as bait, Pip!
You're bait!

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:38.074
- Bait? Being baited the fuck where?
- Yes!

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:43.112
If you lose the fight with Anjo on purpose,
that means one thing.

01:30:43.896 --> 01:30:46.399
They'll beat the shit out of you!

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:51.754
They'll beat you until you're dead
or bedridden for life!

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:55.583
What the hell are you saying? Kate?

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:59.746
That's what they're paying
for in large fights.

01:31:01.059 --> 01:31:04.584
And Anjo never plays in the small ones.

01:31:09.756 --> 01:31:14.802
Please, if you survive this fight,
just let me know.

01:31:17.018 --> 01:31:21.017
This is the address. Find me.

01:31:26.121 --> 01:31:27.289
Kate, pick up.

01:31:28.843 --> 01:31:32.774
Where are you?
Where are we meeting?

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:38.826
Kate? Kate?

01:31:39.702 --> 01:31:40.995
Damn it!

01:31:51.964 --> 01:31:53.049
Bro, good morning.

01:31:57.386 --> 01:31:58.846
Sir, please place your stuff here.

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:05.640
I think that Buddhist saying got
it wrong when they said that

01:34:05.665 --> 01:34:08.167
they should kill the illusion
of Buddha before them.

01:34:08.904 --> 01:34:10.072
Because, I'm...

01:34:10.539 --> 01:34:12.207
I'm willing to kill

01:34:12.232 --> 01:34:15.527
just to keep the most
beautiful illusion I have.
